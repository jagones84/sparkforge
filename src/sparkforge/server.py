"""SparkForge — frontier-style agent harness server for the DGX Spark.

Wraps the local llama.cpp router (127.0.0.1:8080) with:
  - streaming chat with Chain-of-Thought timeline
  - model-generated PLAN (strategy steps)
  - TASKS board with remaining bullets
  - a safe agent loop (thought -> action -> observation; no shell)
  - an SSE loopback feed (/api/feed) for WebUI + mobile live views
  - a mobile command API (bind 0.0.0.0 to reach the phone over Tailscale)

Stdlib only. Data lives in ./data (gitignored). Optional bearer token auth.

    The chat loop learned this the hard way (JAG-61): the observation produced at
    step N MUST be visible at step N+1, or the model re-derives everything, never
    learns a tool/subagent result, cannot correct a rejected action and loops
    forever. The agent loop rebuilt its messages from scratch every iteration and
    dropped every observation -> an open loop. This renders the recent history.
