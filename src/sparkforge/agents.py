"""Agents — every SparkForge session is a full-harness AGENT (id AX).

A session may be *designated* as an ORG AGENT: it then carries a name, a role and a
`reports_to` link (an org chart) and can take part in JOBS. Ad-hoc sessions stay
untouched. This registry is the single source of truth the GUI reads to badge org
agents and to guard their deletion.

Object model (see .agent/design-agents-jobs.md):
  * Agent  = a session, id ``AX``  (todos are ``AX.nY``)
  * Job    = a higher-level goal ``JN`` that orchestrates several agents (jobs.py)

Storage: one JSON file (``SPARKFORGE_AGENTS_FILE``, default ``data/agents.json``).
