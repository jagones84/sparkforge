"""Jobs — higher-level goals (JN) that orchestrate one or many agents (AX).

A job has a goal, a coordinator agent, a set of member agents, optional ``deps`` (a
DAG: who runs before whom), optional ``blocked_by`` (inter-job dependencies) and a
mode:

  * ``coordinator`` (default): the coordinator decomposes the goal, every worker runs
    its slice, then the coordinator aggregates the team's results.
  * ``fanout``: every agent receives the same goal independently.

Execution reuses the normal per-session turn machinery (``server.chat_stream_gen``),
so each agent turn is a real, persisted turn with its own task list. Independent agents
of the same dependency wave run in parallel threads; the next wave waits for the
previous one — this is SparkForge's "several agents working together", and it is safe
because turns serialise per session, never globally.

Storage: ``SPARKFORGE_JOBS_FILE`` (default ``data/jobs.json``).
