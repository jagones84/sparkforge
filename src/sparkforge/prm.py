"""SparkForge v0.95 — process reward / verification engine (prm).

A lightweight, inference-time course-corrector for the agent loop. It scores a
trajectory against an INEFFICIENCY TAXONOMY (spec / reasoning / coordination
errors) and renders a compact natural-language correction that the harness
injects back into the transcript — the same mechanism the frontier harnesses
ship as a Process Reward Model (PRM), but the deterministic core here needs no
model call, so it is cheap, safe and unit-testable.

Rationale (arXiv): 2504.00891 (GenPRM), 2502.10325 (AgentPRM),
2604.16529 (Scaling Test-Time Compute for Agentic Coding). The deterministic
rules cover the failure modes that recur in long-horizon coding runs
(repetition, premature "done", verification skipped).
