"""Server-Sent Events plumbing + chain-of-thought delta coalescing.

Terminal SSE streams (a chat turn, an agent run) must end — and the socket must
close — shortly after their terminal ``done`` event; they must never outlive it.
The heartbeat + idle guards keep a mobile/proxy channel alive during a silent

reach the SSE stream and the durable feed.
