"""Best-of-N with ranker (JAG-132).

Test-time compute "compute-optimal": for a NON-trivial step the harness samples
N candidates from the model and picks the best one with a deterministic ranker
(`prm.rank_text`), instead of accepting the first. For easy tasks (N=1) the
behavior stays identical: no overhead.

PURE module: the selection logic does not depend on the server. The generation of
the candidates (N calls to the model) is the caller's responsibility; here only
`choose()` + the config defaults live.
