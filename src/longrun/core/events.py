"""Durable event log + live SSE feed + per-session turn locks.

The SQLite `events` table is the durable REPLAY buffer (not an archive): the live
in-memory deque feeds SSE subscribers, and the log answers post-mortem queries.
`publish()` is the single write path; `_ACTIVE_CHAT` is the SERVER TRUTH for
whether a session is "running" (the session list reads it). Turn locks serialise
one chat turn per session.
