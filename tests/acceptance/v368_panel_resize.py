"""v368 — Resizing the side panels: mouse AND touch, columns AND drawers (JAG-368).

Locked here:
  * the border grip runs on POINTER events, so a FINGER works, not just a mouse
    (before this a phone could not resize a panel at all);
  * the grip has `touch-action:none` and out-stacks the circular collapse handle —
    the handle is centred ON the border and its mousedown called stopPropagation,
    so pressing the border at its centre was swallowed by the handle and the border
    never moved (it toggled the panel instead);
  * a panel that is a fixed DRAWER (narrow layout) is resized through a CSS var, with
    a grip glued to its inner edge (positionDrawerResizers);
  * the panel clamps account for the open editor dock (_dockRoomW), and opening or
    closing the dock re-fits the panels (editor.js _notifyLayout -> _settleHandles);
  * the dock itself can never grow so wide that it shoves the inspector off the right
    edge (JAG-369): only the collapse arrows may hide a panel, a resize must not.
Deterministic, no browser. Run: python3 tests/acceptance/v368_panel_resize.py
