"""v274 — chat/todo UI coherence (JAG-274).

The chat must read as a CHRONOLOGICAL stream: the newest work is always at the
bottom, a todo step is an inline collapsible section, a sticky "current step"
bar shows what the agent is doing NOW even when the step scrolled up, clicking a
sidebar todo jumps the chat to that step, and a re-plan announcement is drawn
BEFORE the steps it produced (never buried under the list).

Static source assertions (no browser, no server): the WebUI is a single file and
these JS invariants are what we can freeze deterministically. Single-line probes
only (the file may carry CRLF).

Run: python3 tests/v274_chat_stream.py
