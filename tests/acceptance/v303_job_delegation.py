"""v303 — coordinator delegation: each worker gets ONLY its own assignment (JAG-303).

Observed live on J2: every worker received the WHOLE plan as "Your assignment"
(all four bullets, including the other agents' parts), so the workers had to guess
which slice was theirs and redid each other's work. Locked here:
  * `JobRegistry._assignment_for` returns the single plan line naming the agent;
  * it falls back to the whole plan when the agent is not named, and to "" on empty;
  * the worker message is built from that single line.

Deterministic, no live model. Run: python3 tests/v303_job_delegation.py
