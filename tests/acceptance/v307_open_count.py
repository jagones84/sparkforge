"""v307 — the UI must not count CLOSED states as open (JAG-307).

After JAG-306 closed the job's todos, the coordinator session still LOOKED
unfinished: its graph has 22 done + 3 superseded, yet the deck's TASKS chip said
"3 open / 25" and the panel could resurface old plans' steps. `superseded` and
`cancelled` are CLOSED. Locked here (marker checks on the UI sources):
  * the deck chip counts ONLY truly-open statuses (todo/doing/blocked);
  * the Plan panel mark table renders `superseded` as closed;
  * the panel never falls back to the UNION of every plan's nodes.

Deterministic, no browser. Run: python3 tests/v307_open_count.py
