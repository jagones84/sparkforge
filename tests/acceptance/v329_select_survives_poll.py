"""v329 — the Orbit 5s poll must not destroy an OPEN <select> (JAG-329).

The agents table is rebuilt every 5 seconds (`setInterval(() => this.refresh(), 5000)`
-> AgentsView.render -> body.innerHTML = ...). It already deferred the rebuild while a
text field was focused, but NOT while a native <select> (the MODEL / REPORTS-TO
dropdown) was open — so choosing a model closed itself "after a timer, even while it
is open for selection". The guard must cover every form control.

Deterministic, source-locked. Run: python3 tests/acceptance/v329_select_survives_poll.py
