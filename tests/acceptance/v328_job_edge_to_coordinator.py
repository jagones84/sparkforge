"""v328 — a job's assign edge goes to its COORDINATOR only (JAG-328).

In the constellation, J7 was drawn with an assign arrow to EVERY member (J7 -> A8
AND J7 -> A9). But the job is given to the MASTER (A8) alone; the piece handed to A9
is the SUBJOB J7.1, already drawn as J7.1 -> A9. The job->member arrow was a FALSE
edge duplicating the subjob edge — misleading and structurally wrong.

Deterministic, source-locked. Run: python3 tests/acceptance/v328_job_edge_to_coordinator.py
