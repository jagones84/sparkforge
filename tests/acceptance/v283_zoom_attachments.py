"""v283 — gradual zoom, clickable chat attachments, and plan/dispatch guidance.

JAG-283 (user):
  * Ctrl+± was the browser's coarse zoom — make it gradual;
  * an attached file must be openable from the chat (file -> editor, image -> the
    image window);
  * the model wrote todos AFTER answering and left them open — the policy/nudge must
    forbid planning work already done.

Deterministic, no live server. Run: python3 tests/v283_zoom_attachments.py
