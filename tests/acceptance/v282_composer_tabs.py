"""v282 — composer toolbar never wraps; editor tabs expose their path + copy-path.

JAG-282 (user): the composer toolbar wrapped onto a second line and looked broken,
and the open editor tabs gave no way to know a file's full path / whether it is in
the workspace, nor to copy it.

Locked here:
  * the composer bar is one row when it fits; on a narrow phone width it WRAPS (the
    model picker is the only flexible element and it truncates) — it must never shrink
    into an overlap;
  * every editor tab shows its full path on hover and has a right-click menu with
    'copy path' (mirroring the file tree), a 'reveal in file tree' action, and an
    outside-the-workspace marker (tab + status bar).

Deterministic, no live server. Run: python3 tests/v282_composer_tabs.py
