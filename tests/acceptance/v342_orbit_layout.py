"""v342 — Orbit layout: single column, whole org chart visible (JAG-342).

Reported (user): the ORG CHART panel was CLIPPED (did not show the whole organigram),
the page grew a horizontal scrollbar while the chart ALSO had a transform pan
("se c'è il pan a che serve la scrollbar?"), and the panels were laid out "a cazzo".
Wanted: one panel under the other (mobile style).

Fix: every page row is a single column; the org chart scrolls NATIVELY inside its
panel (the transform pan is gone); switching team resets the constellation focus.

Deterministic, no model. Run: python3 tests/acceptance/v342_orbit_layout.py
